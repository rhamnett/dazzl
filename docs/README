You are required to install the SWT runtime packages:

To build with ant:

ant -buildfile adm.xml all
(you may have to edit the xml files with your own java version)

to fire up:

java -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib

(this is where the libswt-gtk.so is.....or in windows put the dll in c:\windows\system32)
