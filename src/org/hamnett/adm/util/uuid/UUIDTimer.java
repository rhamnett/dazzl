/**
 * UUIDTimer produces the time stamps required for time-based UUIDs.
 * It works according to UUID-specification, with following
 * modifications:
 *
 *<ul>
 *<li>Java libs can only product time stamps with maximum resolution
 *   of one millisecond. To compensate, an additional counter is used,
 *   so that more than one UUID can be generated between java clock
 *   updates. Counter may be used to generate up to 10000 UUIDs for
 *   each distrinct java clock value (which in some cases may mean
 *   getting 10k UUIDs for each 55 msecs, a la Windows, ie only
 *   about 200000 UUIDs per second).
 *<li> An additional precaution, counter is initialized not to 0
 *   but to a random 8-bit number, and each time clock changes, lowest
 *   8-bits of counter are preserved. The purpose it to make likelyhood
 *   of multi-JVM multi-instance generators to collide, without significantly
 *   reducing max. UUID generation speed. Note though that using more than
 *   one generator (from separate JVMs) is strongly discouraged, so
 *   hopefully this enhancement isn't needed.
 *   This 8-bit offset has to be reduced from total max. UUID count to
 *   preserve ordering property of UUIDs (ie. one can see which UUID
 *   was generated first for given UUID generator); the resulting
 *   9500 UUIDs isn't much different from the optimal choice.
 *</ul>
 *<p>
 *Some additional assumptions about calculating the timestamp:
 *<ul>
 *<li>System.currentTimeMillis() is assumed to give time offset in UTC,
 *   or at least close enough thing to get correct timestamps. The
 *   alternate route would have to go through calendar object, use
 *   TimeZone offset to get to UTC, and then modify. Using currentTimeMillis
 *   should be much faster to allow rapid UUID creation.
 *<li>Similarly, the constant used for time offset between 1.1.1970 and
 *  start of Gregorian calendar is assumed to be correct (which seems
 *  to be the case when testing with Java calendars).
 *</ul>
